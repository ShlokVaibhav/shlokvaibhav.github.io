<h3><center><a name="Blog">My 2 cents</a></center></h3>
<h2><center>Institutionalizing small dose habits</center></h2>
First I will define by what is meant by small dose habits:

<p><I></p>
By Small dose habits, I refer to those habits which are beneficial when performed
for a small amount of time but overindulgence in them is harmful because of plateauing
benefit and steep opportunity cost.
</I>
<p></p>
Some of the common examples are social media usage, reading blogs but mostly i will not refer
to common hobbies and activities. Instead, I will tell my own experience, I had recently started reading books, but what 
started happening was that I would not read books for a few days, and then suddenly, I would spend an entire day reading books,
checking reviews on good reads, TE, NYT etc, researching the highlights I had earlier took.
<p></p>
Not that this is undesirable, ofcourse you may say that instead of doing little progress each day, I am doing all progress in a single day which is more compact and 
hence more desirable?? A person who follows routine 6 days and then binge-reads-researches the 7th day is indeed on good track!
<p></p>
But what if reading books is not the only hobby? What a person has an additional hobby of learning a language?
This entails mugging new words, speaking, listening and comprehension exercises over the week?
Now one day of the week he is on reading-binge and another day he is binge-language learner.
Now some worry? One day he makes excuse that he didn't work as he was binge reading 
and the next day he makes the excuse he didn't work as he was binge learning.
<br>
Professional? - No!
<br>
If by any chance, I were to add a third hobby, this person probably will start looking like a failure to his colleagues who doesn't show 
up for work 3/7 days:
Day 1:" Hi, couldn't do the assigned task as I was reading 6 hours "
<br>
Day 2:"Hi, actually today, my language lessons were pending so i took 8 hours to finish"
<br>
Day 3: "Hi, ..."
<br> 

Is there a way to tame such habits such that dopamine doesn't built up to a level where an entire day 
or two is needed to get minds back to sanity?
(By now you must be realizing, habits were a pretext, now our scope is broadened to include chronic procrastination)

<p></p>
I, for one, have this issue, and I had been thinking since months is there a way to mend this structure??
I have 4 such interests that are eating 4 days/week, so I definitely cannot afford to take this spontaneous full-of-life approach.
For me, it is clear some oversight and forcing of hand is needed.
<p></p>
I am not entirely sure but this is what i think should work:

<ul>
<li> Currently, my mind is anarchist, it thinks reading no book for 6 days and then reading 
    an entire day is cool and it can do whatever it wants to do 
</li>

</ul>

We may give a mild experiment to my brain, now on, I decree since its love for book is so strong, it will have to read a book for atleast 1.5 hours each day.
If it yawns or falls asleep in midst, it will really contradict the claim that reading is its passion, for how can one get bored with passion in just 1.5 hours 
a day? And if it is really a passion and even 1 hour a day is enough to tame it, then why not tame it with exactly this??


<p></p>

So I will give my mind its own medicine, since it has such and such passion for books, languages, news and freelancing, I will assign to it some mandatory tasks in each of these realms each day.
Trust me, I have more than enough time for doing this.

So here is the testament:

<ul>
    <li>
    Mandatory book reading, review checking or reading research for one hour, even on days I dont feel like doing it
    </li>
    <li>
Daily 2 new words from three languages each (total 6, doable) you must find, write down and learn each day.
And weekly 3 articles of your choice, you must translate. Enjoy your passion!
    </li>
    <li>
You must daily review 3 newspapers, two Indian and one foreign. 
    </li>
</ul>

The idea here is not be mean to oneself, but to use a bit of psychology I have studied about habits and fashion 
to be utilized. If the desire for some activity is daily quenched, will the desire keep growing or really get quenched??
<pr></pr>
As per my writing, it would seem I support this, then would giving ample to a drunkard daily make him control his addiction ? 
I dont think this happens, but since I am not a psychologist, it is the fault of reader to really think I mean all these generalizations.
<pr></pr>
But, in this case I have found an unexpected supporter - The Creed

<pr></pr>
Indic philosophers take a dull approach to explaining the world. One of their key claims is:
<p><I></p>
    Soon after its creation, the soul indulges into all worldly pleasures and forgets itself
    it then proceeds to experience all the accompanying misery as well. But do not stop it, let is experience all that 
    it wants to experience, in as much depth as it wants, for it will gradually realize that this addiction can take it only thus far. It will gradually get bored 
    and move to a new addiction. Again, don't stop it. Let it experience and desire all that it wants to. Time will come, it will see that it has experienced everything that was possible
    . There is nothing more in this world that is worthy of experience and it will thus fix its sight on the question of existence.    
</I>
<p></p>
This is how Indian philosophy explains the difference between great saints and ordinary people, the great saints have already realized the futility of the world via their past desires and indulgances 
and desire no more of it.

<p></p>
So i hope, by forcing myself into habits, I am hoping to get bored out of it. This has happened already for my youtube addiction. 
All the nice self-help videos, economics DIY expert accounts I have enjoyed for long and realized their futility in one way or other, 
earlier I had to uninstall youtube to curb usage, but now it lies in one corner of screen, unopened for hours (and sometimes days)
